# Different-Things
## Installation
- First download all the files from this repo. What you have to run is the file main_gui.py from the gui folder, do not change anything else. Once you have download it, it won't work because the models are not in this repo. So in order to access the models go to this drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hzWBLmvei-kfJvSrpZxWutIs-kSthkhC?usp=sharing and download every file that is inside.
- Then with everything downloaded create a folder named models and put all the files from the drive link into that folder.
You use get something like this. (Forget all the other folders you don't have, they are venvs folder that you will have in a moment).

- Next install the requirements and if you want create a virtual env before so you will have the same folders.
- Extra thing: You may have problems with hugging face library or something. If that is the case just create a folder name cache (doesn't need to be where mine you can just create one in the C:\\User\.cache and it's fine) and change the path to that.  

## Usage
- As said before only run the main_gui.py file inside the gui folder. The first time it will take more time than usual, this is normal because is importing everything as well as if it's the first time you run the models and you have a GPU that use CUDA it will take time the first time.  
- So once the main window appear you will see something like this.
