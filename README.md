## Installation
- First download all the files from this repo. What you have to run is the file main_gui.py from the gui folder, everything else do not touch it. Once you have download it, it won't work because the models are not in this repo. So in order to access the models go to this drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hzWBLmvei-kfJvSrpZxWutIs-kSthkhC?usp=sharing and download every file that is inside.
- Then with everything downloaded create a folder named models and put all the files from the drive link into that folder.
You use get something like this. (Forget all the other folders you don't have, they are venvs folder that you will have in a moment).
